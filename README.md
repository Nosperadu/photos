# Jonas Németh — Photography

A curated selection of my work in **street, architecture, and landscape photography**.  
Minimal. Timeless. Personal.

## Selected Works

### Street
Capturing fleeting moments in the rhythm of the city — candid, raw, and alive.  

### Architecture
Exploring structure, symmetry, and the dialogue between light and form.  

### Landscape
Silence, scale, and solitude — the way nature humbles and inspires.

## About Me
I’m **Jonas Németh**, a photographer and IT apprentice based in Dresden.  
I explore the world with a Canon R8 and a mix of modern RF lenses and vintage Pentacon Six glass.  

Photography for me is **a way of slowing down**, of seeing the unnoticed, and turning it into something permanent.
